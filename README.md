[![](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/message-format)](https://crates.io/crates/message-format)

A library based on [ICU MessageFormat](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages) for formatting messages in internationalized applications.

Dual licensed under the MIT and Apache 2 licenses.

## Installation

This crate works with Cargo and is on
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/message-format).
Add it to your `Cargo.toml` like so:

```toml
[dependencies]
message-format = "0.0.1"
```

## Status of Implementation

Things are under active development. This project is not quite
usable yet as some of the basic functionality is being written.

I also don't like the current API for users.
